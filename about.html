        <p1> This poem follows a Terza rima style and was written as a back and forth between Tom and Dan, each person writing one stanza to build on the previous. This structure of creating layers to words was then brought into the design of the presentation which invites the reader to click on the page to start a rippling sandpile effect. The animation is a representation of the sandpile model, in which each position can contain no more than 4 grains of ‘sand’. When these piles grow too high, they topple and send their grains to the space around them. This simple process can create incredibly complex and interesting patterns which share many qualities with the processes that Tom studies. </p1><br>

        <p1> The image behind this poem is taken from Tom’s research. In some sense it shows the quantum structure of electrons, in a hot system at the top of the page, cooling down as we go down the page until we reach a completely orderly ‘frozen’ state at the bottom. This served as the inspiration for the poem’s content which plays on the relationship between order and chaos, within Tom’s research as well as more generally. In both realms the most interesting things tend to happen when the two are balanced.</p1><br>
