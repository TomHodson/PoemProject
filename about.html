        <div class = "intro"><p1>As part of Imperial College London&apos;s <a class = "inline" href = "https://www.dansimpsonpoet.co.uk/imperial-college-verse-research">poet-in-residence outreach program</a>, poet Dan Simpson has collaborated with Tom Hodson, a PhD student in physics. Using Tom's research into collective behaviour and unconventional states of matter as inspiration, Dan and Tom collaborated to create poetry on the themes of chaos, order and heat. They chose to give the pieces a digital format with changing visual elements to reinforce the science behind each text. Produced with creative computing student Sophie Nadel, these are the resulting poetry experiments.</p1></div>

        <p1>Tom is a PhD student at Imperial College London looking at how electrons behave within disordered crystal lattices. He spends his work days writing code, doing mathematics and occasionally colaborating on crazy projects like this one. His studies have brought him from his hometown near Birmingham, through Cambridge, physics travels to CERN, Geneva and Samarkand, Uzbekistan to London where he&apos;s currently based... and occasionaly Munich. In his spare time, he likes to build things, bake bread and dabbles in keeping bees. </p1>
