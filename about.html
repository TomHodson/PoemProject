Using Tom's research into collective behaviour and unconventional states of matter as inspiration, Dan and Tom collaborated to create poetry on the themes of chaos, order and heat. They chose to give the pieces a digital format with changing visual elements to reinforce the science behind each text. Produced with creative computing student Sophie Nadel, these are the resulting poetry experiments.</p1></div>
