Using Tom&apos;s research as a starting point, Dan and Tom worked together to produce poetry on the themes of chaos, order and heat. Produced in collaboration with Sophie Nadel, they chose to give the piece a digital format whose changing visual elements were created to reinforce the themes of each text.</p1></div>
