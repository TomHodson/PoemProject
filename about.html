<h2>Intro</h2>
    
(guessing here) As part of Imperial college’s outreach program, Dan Simpson has been a virtual poet-in-residence at the college. He has worked with three researchers to produce joint pieces. These pieces were made in collaboration with Tom Hodson, a physics PhD student working on how electrons behave in disordered lattices. This served as the starting point for Dan and Tom to work together to produce poetry on the themes of chaos, order, heat. Giving the piece a digital format allowed us to add a dynamic element to the text.  Produced in collaboration with Sophie Nadel, these changing visual elements were created to reinforce the themes of each text.

<h2>Sandpile</h2>

This poem follows a Terza rima style and was written as a back and forth between Tom and Dan, each person writing one stanza to build on the previous. This structure of creating layers to words was then brought into the design of the presentation which invites the reader to click on the page to start a rippling sandpile effect. The animation is a representation of the sandpile model, in which each position can contain no more than 4 grains of ‘sand’. When these piles grow too high, they topple and send their grains to the space around them. This simple process can create incredibly complex and interesting patterns which share many qualities with the processes that Tom studies.

<h2>Academia</h2>

*Dan inserts his thoughts* For this poem we chose to emulate the visual style of a typical academic research paper, coupled with the rigid form of a sonnet. We pierce this structured environment by beginning to swap and jumble the words of the poem, moving away from the order to something more chaotic.

<h2>Critical Point </h2>

The image behind this poem is taken from Tom’s research. In some sense it shows the quantum structure of electrons, in a hot system at the top of the page, cooling down as we go down the page until we reach a completely orderly ‘frozen’ state at the bottom. This served as the inspiration for the poem’s content which plays on the relationship between order and chaos, within Tom’s research as well as more generally. In both realms the most interesting things tend to happen when the two are balanced.
