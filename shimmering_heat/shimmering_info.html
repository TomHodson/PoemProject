The image behind this poem is taken from Tom’s research. In some sense it shows the quantum structure of electrons, in a hot system at the top of the page, cooling down as we go down the page until we reach a completely ordered frozen state at the bottom. This served as the inspiration for the poem’s content which plays on the relationship between order and chaos, within Tom’s research as well as more generally. In both realms the most interesting things tend to happen when the two are balanced.
