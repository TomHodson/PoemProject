As part of Imperial College London's [poet-in-residence outreach program](https://www.dansimpsonpoet.co.uk/imperial-college-verse-research), poet Dan Simpson has collaborated with Tom Hodson, a PhD student in physics. Using Tom&apos;s research as a starting point, Dan and Tom worked together to produce poetry on the themes of chaos, order and heat. Produced in collaboration with Sophie Nadel, they chose to give the piece a digital format whose changing visual elements were created to reinforce the themes of each text.
