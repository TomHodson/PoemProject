    We are new born and drop onto this sphere<br>
    a simple act that causes a cascade<br>
    our lived effects deepening year on year.<br>
    <br>
    Each scene flickers past in heady parade<br>
    itâ€™s rare a restful moment one might find<br>
    to ponder on the patterns we have made.<br>
    <br>
    Tumbling down the slopes of the daily grind<br>
    we fragile fragments of humanity<br>
    our sand-dune paths sometimes feel misaligned.<br>
    <br>
    Faltering footsteps find calamity<br>
    though you must admit, some clouds are silvered:<br>
    shiny chaos to contrast sanity.<br>
    <br>
    For an ordered life that's safely filtered<br>
    is dull: revel in being bewildered.<br>
