        <p>Dan Simpson has been working in collaboration with Tom Hodson to create poetry relating to *whatever tom does* as part of a residency with Imperial *proper uni name*. The work looks at patterns in Tomâ€™s research and plays with the concepts of order and entropy when creating a structured poem such as a sonnet.</p>
