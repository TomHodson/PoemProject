He has worked with three researchers to produce joint pieces. These pieces were made in collaboration with Tom Hodson, a physics PhD student working on how electrons behave in disordered lattices. This served as the starting point for Dan and Tom to work together to produce poetry on the themes of chaos, order, heat. Giving the piece a digital format allowed us to add a dynamic element to the text.  Produced in collaboration with Sophie Nadel, these changing visual elements were created to reinforce the themes of each text.</div>
